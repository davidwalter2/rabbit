"""The projected saturated test must run BLINDED, and must still warm-start.

Two properties of ``save_hists`` in ``bin/rabbit_fit.py``, both of which failed
silently before the commits this file ships with.

1. THE SATURATED FIT MUST NOT UNBLIND ITSELF. The composite re-init recreates
   the offset Variables at the composite size, which creates them at zero.
   Nothing re-armed them, so the saturated fit ran in an unblinded
   frame and wrote the ORIGINAL model's POI in the clear into
   ``results[...]["saturated_fit"]["parms"]`` -- an analysis asking for this
   test on data was unblinding itself in its own output file.

2. THE WARM START MUST ACTUALLY LAND ON THE MAIN FIT'S LOSS. The saturated
   bin scales are not among the blocks the warm start copies, so they keep
   ``x0default``. They come out at 1 because ``SaturatedProjectModel`` declares
   them as POUs -- they are the test's own machinery, not a result -- and POUs
   are never offset. Blind them and the composite opens far above the main fit
   and ``q = 2*(NLL_main - NLL_sat)`` starts NEGATIVE, which is not a deviance.

3. THE REGULARIZERS MUST BE ARMED BEFORE THE BLINDED-START CHECK. The composite
   re-init also discharges ``_regularizers_armed`` (the layout changed), and
   ``set_blinding_offsets(True)`` ends in
   ``_check_blinded_start_is_evaluable()``, which COMPUTES THE LOSS.
   ``_compute_nll_components()`` refuses to evaluate a loss whose regularizers
   are unarmed, so a blinded, regularized saturated test died outright -- and
   said "the blinded starting point is outside the range this model can be
   evaluated at", which is the outer half of a chained exception and blames the
   wrong thing entirely. It takes all three (blinding, a regularizer, this
   test) to reproduce, which is why the two properties above could be written
   without noticing it.

Every check is an INVARIANCE or a guard, and each one asserts that blinding is
genuinely armed first, so none of them can pass vacuously through an
accidentally unblinded fitter.
