"""Tests for multi-device (bins-sharded) likelihood evaluation.

Without GPUs the shards all land on the CPU (sharding.select_devices
falls back with a warning), which exercises every piece of the sharded
machinery -- the bin slicing, the per-shard BinByBinStat, the borrowed
methods, the per-shard tapes, the partial-sum combiners -- with no
device separation. Device *placement* correctness was established
separately on a 4-GPU node (see rabbit/sharding.py).

The bar everywhere is near-bitwise agreement with the single-device
path: sharding is a memory layout, not an approximation.
