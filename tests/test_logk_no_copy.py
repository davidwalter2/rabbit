"""The 'normal' systematic scaling is applied after the contraction, not baked
into a copy of logk.

For systematic_type == "normal" the param-model factor rnorm_init used to be
absorbed into logk at construction, allocating a second full-size
[nbins, nproc, nsyst] tensor (and rebuilding the CSR matrix in sparse mode).
rnorm_init carries no systematic index, so it factors out of the contraction:

    sum_s (rnorm_init[b,p] * logk[b,p,s]) * theta[s]
      == rnorm_init[b,p] * sum_s logk[b,p,s] * theta[s]

and it is applied to the [nbins, nproc] result instead. These tests pin both
halves of that: that no copy is made, and that dropping it changes nothing.
