"""Optional preconditioning of the fit parameters.

WHY. The trust-region minimizers solve their subproblem in a *spherical* trust
region, and the Krylov/CG inner solve converges in a number of Hessian-vector
products that grows like sqrt(kappa) of the Hessian. When a block of
parameters is strongly correlated -- typically many unconstrained,
weakly-identified coefficients of a smooth parameterisation, where the basis is
not orthogonal under the data's own weight -- kappa is huge, the inner solve
struggles, and the outer step is rejected. The symptom is outer iterations that
cost minutes and return a bit-identical loss.

WHAT. We reparameterise. With theta the physical parameters, y the internal
ones, theta_ref the point the transform was built at, and a reference Hessian
H0 = L L^T restricted to a selected block:

    theta = theta_ref + T y,     T = L^-T   ->   T^T H0 T = I

so the Hessian in y is the identity at theta_ref and the spherical trust region
in y is an H0-aligned ellipsoid in theta. That is exactly preconditioning, but
obtained as a change of variables, which means **the minimizer is untouched**:
scipy's trust-krylov (GLTR/_trlib) accepts no user preconditioner, and it does
not need to.

The chain rule gives what the scipy callbacks must return:

    loss_y(y)      = loss(theta(y))
    grad_y         = T^T grad_theta
    (H_y p)        = T^T H_theta (T p)

T and T^T are applied as dense matvecs against a cached L^-1, which is formed
once at construction. A triangular solve would do the same flops but is
inherently sequential and so cannot use more than one core; the matvec is a
parallel GEMV and measured ~20x faster at m=2112 (0.09 ms vs 1.9 ms). The
triangular solve is kept as a fallback. Forming the inverse is safe here:
against a direct solve it agrees to ~1e-15 even at cond(H)=1e12.

That is worth stating explicitly because the older *offline* in-situ basis had
to row-normalise its L^-1, which looks like a warning against explicit
inverses. It was not one. There the transform reshaped the basis in which the
histmaker precomputed its delta=0.01 finite variations, so a large T moved the
linearisation point far from where those templates were valid -- a modelling
constraint, not a numerical-stability one. Here T is applied to exact vectors
inside the fit, so that failure mode does not arise.

Parameters outside the selected blocks are passed through untouched, so the
transform is a no-op there and a block can be as small as one wants.

FINDING THE BLOCKS. The clusters can be read off the reference matrix instead
of being named by hand: threshold the correlation matrix and take connected
components (see :func:`auto_blocks`). On the in-situ efficiency fit that
recovers 239 components where the parameterisation has 240 (step, eta, charge)
blocks, with no knowledge of parameter names, and costs ~4e4 times fewer flops
to factorise than one joint block, since Cholesky is O(m^3).

SEVERAL BLOCKS. The transform is block diagonal: each selected group of
parameters gets its own factorisation and they are applied independently. That
is not only cheaper (m^3 per block instead of (sum m)^3) but often the only
thing that works -- a union of two individually well-behaved groups can be
singular, because the groups are nearly degenerate *with each other*, and one
joint Cholesky then fails where two separate ones succeed. The price is that
correlations between blocks are left alone, so blocks should be chosen to be
the strongly-correlated clusters.

SCOPE. Preconditioning buys little for constrained nuisances: their unit
Gaussian prior contributes the identity, H = I + J^T W J, so kappa is bounded.
The win is for *unconstrained* parameters and POIs, which is the default scope.

Everything here operates on numpy arrays at the scipy boundary; the fitter
keeps holding physical parameters in its tf.Variable, so nothing downstream
(covariance, impacts, pulls) needs to know that preconditioning happened.
