"""Multi-device (bins-sharded) evaluation of the likelihood.

The NLL is a plain sum over bins plus parameter-level terms, and every
large tensor in the fit (logk, norm, nobs, sumw/sumw2, beta) is
bins-proportional. Sharding the bins axis over N devices therefore
splits both the memory and the compute, while the only things that ever
cross devices per evaluation are the parameter vector going out and one
[nparams] partial (gradient / HVP) per shard coming back -- kilobytes
against the gigabytes each shard reads locally.

The two structural rules, established empirically (bench/poc_multigpu.py
on 4 GPUs):

1. Backward placement must be explicit. A single GradientTape over the
   combined multi-device loss computes correct values but the placer
   puts the backward ops on one device, dragging every shard's logk
   across the bus per call (measured 6.5 ms -> 135 ms at 4 shards).
   Hence: one tape per shard, differentiating with respect to a
   device-local copy of x, so each shard's backward subgraph is anchored
   to its device. The combined loss+grad returned to 4.5 ms.
2. XLA clusters are single-device: each shard's function is jit-compiled
   on its own, and the thin combiner stays a plain (non-jit) graph.

Rather than duplicating the yields/NLL mathematics, each shard is a
duck-typed evaluator object exposing the attributes the existing Fitter
methods read (indata view, logk slice, nobs, bbstat, param model, x);
the Fitter's own unbound methods are then bound onto it, so symmetric
and asymmetric interpolation, both systematic types, and the full
bin-by-bin-stat machinery are shared with the single-device path by
construction.

Not supported in sharded mode: sparse tensors and --covarianceFit
(checked at construction), regularizers whose penalty reads the predicted
yields (needs_observables=True -- no device holds the full yield vector;
checked in arm_regularizers, since self.regularizers is still empty when
the constructor runs), --fullNll, and the fwdrev HVP (falls back to
revrev). Parameter-only regularizers ARE supported: their penalty is a
function of the parameter vector, which every device has in full, and it
is evaluated once in the global term.
